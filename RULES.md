# Gemini Rules

1. Always make the changes to be minimal and focused entirely on the task and no other changes allowed, whether design, structure or code. You are not allowed to edit or move any unrelated code either unless specified.

2. Do not assume a change is needed unless specified. Do not change any AI models or anything else for that matter that has not been instructed to change.

3. When faced with a hard problem, do a indepth investigation and keep speculations and assumptions to minimal. Do not assume you have found the issue even if it appears so until you have excluded all other options. Be thorough and don't stop until you have looked at all relevant files, line by line.
